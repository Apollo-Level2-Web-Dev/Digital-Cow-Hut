### Assignment Name: Online Cow Selling Backend for Eid Ul Adha
You have been assigned the task of building the backend for an Online Cow Selling platform in preparation for Eid Ul Adha. The main focus of this assignment is to implement error handling, CRUD operations, pagination and filtering, transactions (including a simple transaction without a payment gateway), and additional routes as necessary. 

### Technology Stack:

- Use TypeScript as the programming language.
- Use Express.js as the web framework.
- Use Mongoose as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) and validation library for MongoDB.


## Main Part : ( 50 Marks )

### Error Handling:

Implement proper error handling throughout the application.
Use global error handling `middleware` to catch and handle errors, providing appropriate error responses with status codes and error messages.

Error Response Object Should include the following properties:
- success  →  false
- message → Error Type → Validation Error, Cast Error, Duplicate Entry
- errorMessages 
- stack

### Sample Error Response

```json
   {
    "success": false,
    "message": "E11000 duplicate key error collection: univerity-management.students index: email_1 dup key: { email: \"user2@gmail.com\" }",
    "errorMessages": [
        {
            "path": "",
            "message": "E11000 duplicate key error collection: univerity-management.students index: email_1 dup key: { email: \"user2@gmail.com\" }"
        }
    ],
    "stack": "MongoServerError: E11000 duplicate key error collection: univerity-management.students index: email_1 dup key: { email: \"user2@gmail.com\" }\n    at H:\\next-level-development\\university-management-auth-service\\node_modules\\mongodb\\src\\operations\\insert.ts:85:25\n    at H:\\next-level-development\\university-management-auth-service\\node_modules\\mongodb\\src\\cmap\\connection_pool.ts:574:11\n    at H:\\next-level-development\\university-writeOrBuffer (node:internal/streams/writable:391:12)"
}
```

#3 Bonus Part : ( 10 Marks )
     
### Implement Create, Read Operations for Order History Listings.

Route:  /api/v1/orders  (POST)

Request body:

```json
{

  "cow":"ObjectId(“6473c6a50c56d0d40b9bb6a3)", // cow reference _id
  "buyer":"ObjectId(“6473c6a50c56d0d40b9bb6a3)", // user reference  _id
}
```

Response: The  newly created order object.

Implement a transactional operation for buying a cow.  When a user requests to buy a cow, simulate a `transaction` process without involving an actual payment gateway. Upon successful transaction simulation, update the cow's status as sold, transfer money from buyer to seller account, and provide appropriate response messages.

Steps:

- The user initiates a purchase order using the "api/v1/orders" POST API.
- Check that the user has enough money in their account to buy the cow.
- If the user needs more money, show them an error message.
- If the user has enough money, begin the buying process (start a transaction). This involves a few steps:
- Change the cow's label from 'for sale' to 'sold out'.
- Deduct the cost of the cow from the buyer's budget
- Put the same amount of  cost into the seller's income
- Make an entry in the orders collection
- Commit transaction
- End transaction session
- If any error happens abort the transaction 



Route:  /api/v1/orders  (GET)

Request body:

Response: The ordered array of objects.

Response Sample Pattern:

```json
  {
      "success": true, 
      "statusCode":200,
      "message": "Orders retrieved successfully",
      "data": {}, 
  }
```
